      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Since April 2022, A small group of independent Shelby County, Ohio
        stakeholders has gathered to begin planning for a few unthinkable
        threats and hazards in a serious and intentional way and from a
        citizen's point of view. We have developed a loose group concept we have
        named Shelby Ready. This group concept is in its infancy, but its role
        will be strictly limited to coordination and information sharing with
        already existing groups and agencies. It is informal and unofficial by
        design to allow for maximum flexibility in our project and planning
        efforts. Shelby Ready is based on the old Civil Defense model of
        citizens taking responsibility and ownership for themselves and their
        communities. Fostering Community and Love of Neighbor are at the core of
        our efforts.

        The scenario we began the project with was a supply chain collapse
        leading to a food shortageâ€”and what we can do to prepare for that
        happening. In talking to other emergency managers and preparedness
        planners about this project, it became obvious that others in the West
        Central and South West Ohio area are also planning for similar
        catastrophes at some level. In the process of comparing notes, it has
        become clear that the availability of Diesel Fuel and Diesel Exhaust
        Fluid (DEF) is foundational to ANY and ALL responses for a large number
        catastrophic events. Diesel is key. If one is watching the news, it is
        becoming clear that the Diesel supply chain is fragile, and our capacity
        to refine and distribute Diesel is one fire, or

        from a complete breakdown. The rapidly evolving threat picture on the
        fuel supply has moved this event up from a late summer workshop to an
        early July timeline - i.e. the recent
