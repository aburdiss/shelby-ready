        <h2>The Essentials</h2>
        <p>
          There's really only three things that are essential for hosting a
          gathering, and having a good time:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Have Snacks And Refreshments</h3>
        <p>
          People are more comfortable if they have good snacks and something to
          drink. Bowls of chips are good, but
          <a
            href="https://justinesnacks.com/the-best-chocolate-chocolate-chip-cookies/"
            >homemade cookies</a
          >
          are better.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Have enough places for everyone to sit</h3>
        <p>
          Borrow some chairs from friends or family if you don't have enough. If
          you want to host often, Sam's Club sells
          <a
            href="https://www.samsclub.com/p/lifetime-folding-chair/162886?xid=plp_product_1"
            >folding chairs that are perfect</a
          >
          for this kind of thing.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Clean your toilet beforehand</h3>
        <p>
          The last essential, is cleaning your toilet. Cleaning your whole
          bathroom is best, but the toilet is the only essential if you don't
          have a lot of time to prepare. Nobody, NOBODY likes using a dirty
          toilet.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
        <h3>Start Small</h3>
        <p>
          It's easier to learn what works and what doesn't with a smaller group
          of people. You can also grow the group after it is started. You can't
          grow what doesn't exist.
        </p>
        <h3>Thermostat</h3>
        <p>
          Prior to the event, set your thermostat a little colder than you
          usually do, since having more people in your house will make the
          temperature rise, and it gets uncomfortable when it gets too hot.
        </p>
        <h3>Alcohol</h3>
        <p>
          Decide if you want to have alcohol, or provide the option of alcohol.
          It's not essential, but it is a social lubricant. Beer and sweet wine
          are usually pretty safe bets that most people will consume, but
          <a href="https://wineryatversailles.com">local options</a> are better
          quality and can be a conversation starter.
        </p>
        <h3>Set Expectations For Guests</h3>
        <p>
          If you don't want to, or can't afford to provide all the snacks, ask
          your guests to bring somethnig small, like a bag of chips or a case of
          pop. You're hosting, the least they can do is to bring something to
          share.
        </p>
        <h3>Have a Goal</h3>
        <p>
          It becomes easier for people to want to show up if there is a clear
          goal for the gathering. This can be as simple as playing board games,
          watching a movie, eating a nice dinner, or having a bible study. It
          doesn't need to be elaborate, but it does help tremendously if
          everyone is already on the same page when they show up.
        </p>
        <h3>Date and Time</h3>
        <p>
          One big question that you may have is what date to host the event on.
          The easiest response would be to have it on a date that works for the
          most people, but this may not always be the best choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a difference between holding your gathering on a weeknight
          vs. a weekend. Holding the gathering on a weeknight will ensure that
          it doesn't extend far into the night, because most people will have to
          work the next day. It also keeps the alcohol consumption lower, since
          people will have to drive home. You will also potentially have
          different crowds if you hold the event on a weekday vs. a weekend.
          Weekday people are the more energetic, motivathed, go-getters and
          do-ers, whereas weekend people also include everyone else, since
          there's less friction. Holding it on a weekday also leaves your and
          their weekends open to do more things that are traditionally hosted on
          weekends. We have had a lot of success by setting the date on a
          weekday, and inviting everyone with a "this is happening, join if you
          want to" mentality.
        </p>
        <h3>Host at a Neutral Location</h3>
        <p>
          If you're worried about hosting at your house, find a neutral location
          for everyone to meet.
          <a
            href="https://www.sidneyoh.com/Facilities/Facility/Details/Tawawa-Park-24"
            >Parks</a
          >, <a href="https://www.greenhauscoffee.com">coffee shops</a>, or
          restaurants can be good candidates.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't Be Afraid to Mix Friend Groups</h3>
        <p>
          Do you know different people from different places, but they don't
          know eachother? Invite them both! Real life interactions are NOT like
          interactions online. People generally act more civil in real life and
          won't jump straight to political arguments. As a couple living in
          Dayton is writing this, we can confirm that this is really not an
          issue.
        </p>
        <h3>Invite Your Neighbors</h3>
        <p>
          If you don't know your neighbors, this can be a great way to get to
          know them. It's always good to know your neighbors and have a way to
          contact them, in case if there is an emergency.
